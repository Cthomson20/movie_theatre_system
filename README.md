# Walkthrough Instructions

On the home page, select the movie of your choice. You can narrow down the options using filters such as date, movie rating, genre, language, and theatre location. After choosing a movie, click the movie offering to begin booking tickets.

Select the **Book Tickets** button. On the next page, choose the theatre you want to watch the movie in, the day you prefer, your ticket type (General, VIP, or Ultra AVX Dolby Atmos), and the specific showtime you want. You can also preview seats for all showtimes to view available seats and accessible seating.

After selecting your showtime, choose your ticket types (General, Child, Senior) and the quantity for each. On this same page, select your seats using the seat selection map.

You will then be taken to the payment page, where a summary of your order will be displayed along with fields to enter your payment details (card number, expiry date, CVV, cardholder name, and an email for purchase confirmation). Finally, you will be taken to the confirmation page to confirm your purchase, with an option to print your tickets. You can also share your tickets to other emails or phone numbers or choose to continue browsing the site.
